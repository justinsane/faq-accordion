## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool

### What I learned

- I learned about the `useRef` hook in React. It is used to create a reference to a DOM element. This is useful when you want to access the DOM element directly, for example to focus for keyboard navigation.

- I learned that Tailwind doesn't have a 'background-image' utility class. I had to use the `bg-[url]` class to set the background image, and also use media queries to set the background image for different screen sizes.

### Continued development

- I had a challenge aligning the container. It was slightly confusing. I will continue to practice aligning elements in the future.
